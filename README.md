# Comfy UI OpenVINO

This ComfyUI workflow generates highly detailed anime-style summer beach scenes using advanced prompts and an upscaling model.  
**Tested on an Intel i7-6700HQ (integrated GPU): 2‚Äì3 seconds per iteration at 512x512 resolution.**

---

## üöÄ Overview

- **Purpose:** Generate anime images, such as multiple girls at the beach, with sunset lighting and cinematic style.
- **Positive prompt:** Focuses on masterpiece quality, expressive faces, dynamic composition, and rich detail.
- **Negative prompt:** Filters out common AI mistakes‚Äîextra limbs, poor anatomy, blur, duplicates, watermarks, etc.
- **Upscaling:** Uses a dedicated anime upscaler for higher-resolution results.
- **Ideal use:** Creating unique anime art, reference graphics, or project assets.

## üß© Requirements

- **ComfyUI** ([latest version](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI))
- **Models:**
  - Anime diffusion model (e.g., Counterfeit, Anything, AOM2, etc.)
  - Upscale model: `2x-AniScale.pth`
- **Hardware:** CUDA-compatible GPU recommended  
  - **CPU/Integrated GPU:** Works (slower). On Intel i7-6700HQ (integrated GPU), generation speed is ~2-3 s/it for 512x512 images.
- **Python >= 3.8**
- **Libraries:**  
  - torch >= 2.0  
  - torchvision  
  - numpy  
- Other ComfyUI dependencies (auto-installed with ComfyUI)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### 1. **Clone ComfyUI**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI
```

### 2. **Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed.

### 3. **Download models**
- Download your preferred **anime diffusion model** (Counterfeit, Anything-v3, AOM2, etc.) and place it into `models/Stable-diffusion/`.
- Download the upscaling model `2x-AniScale.pth` and place it into `models/upscale/`.

### 4. **(Optional) Install OpenVINO Node Support**
If you want to use OpenVINO acceleration:
```bash
# Instructions:
# https://github.com/openvino-dev-samples/comfyui_openvino
```

### 5. **Run ComfyUI**

```bash
# For CPU/integrated graphics
python main.py --cpu --use-pytorch-cross-attention --fast --async-offload --mmap-torch-files

# Or simple launch (will use available GPU if present)
python main.py
```

#### **Performance Note:**  
_On my Intel i7-6700HQ (integrated graphics), generation takes about 2‚Äì3 seconds per iteration for 512x512 images. On a modern GPU, generation can be almost instant._

## üñº Workflow Steps

1.  Install OpenVINO Node if you want hardware acceleration.
2.  Feed your prompts into **CLIPTextEncode** (positive/negative).
3.  Run the image generation with your chosen anime diffusion model.
4.  Apply upscaling via `2x-AniScale.pth` for high-res results.
5.  Save your finished images from the output folder.

---

## üìÇ Usage

- Set up ComfyUI as above.
- Import or recreate the workflow via `.json` file or by configuring the nodes in ComfyUI manually.
- Start generating images with your prompts!

---

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Notes

- If results look odd, experiment with prompts or sampling parameters.
- For best upscaling, use the latest compatible upscaler model.
- CPU & integrated GPU performance will be much lower vs. a dedicated NVIDIA GPU.
